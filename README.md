BUt you must log in.

I'm using an InMemory database, so once you're out, you're out. All data lost. Yikes!

Favorite!
There are instructions and ingredients listed for you. More details about your cocktail <* wink *>
You can click on the image to view it in a larger scale.

You can also delete cocktails from your favorite list, if the taste buds changes. 

With everything going on, always look for the positive and smile - While Sipping your Cocktail
